# Restaurant POS (Point-of-Sale) Fullstack Application

This is the monorepo containing both the frontend and the backend of a resturant management application created by [@surmavagit](https://github.com/surmavagit) and [@denigogov](https://github.com/denigogov) as part of their third project in a 5-month coding bootcamp.

Their cohort was led by their facilitator, [@diraneyya](https://github.com/diraneyya), and was unfortunately the last cohort by _Wild Code School_ in Germany.
